I am a senior at UNC-Chapel Hill graduating in May 2020 with a B.S. in Computer Science and a minor in Statistics.

My primary interests lie in the intersection of **Augmented Reality, Computer Vision and Machine Learning**. I want to build consumer grade, user centric AR HMD'S which leverage the power of holograms and spatial computing to give users a new way to interact with information.

In my free time I like to indoor rock climb and playing video. I believe that coding and software engineering is very similar to rock climbing. Both require careful analysis before each move with multiple ways to solving a problem. 

I hope to go to Mars if the opportunity presents itself.
