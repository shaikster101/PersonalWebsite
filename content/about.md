I am a first-year master's student at UNC-Chapel Hill with a B.S in Computer Science and minor in Statistics.

My primary interests are in the use of Augmented/Virtual Reality and marker less pose estimation for training and rehabilitation. I also dabble in real-time 3D reconstruction and Telepresence systems. 

In my free time I like to indoor rock climb, play video games, paint and tinker with technology. I am also an avid space nut with dreams of going into space!
